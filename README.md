# Basketball
## Looking at scoring trends throughout different NBA eras, and adjusting the stats of old eras to match the pace of play and prominence of three-pointers
### Version 1 uses 15 years of data from basketball reference spreadsheets
### Version 2 uses 40 years of data pulled from the NBA stats api (saved as csv file in code and available here)
## Final output graph uploaded as .html file because github doesn't load plotly due to the size of their graphing files
### V1: TS% vs PPG, V2: EFF vs PPG
